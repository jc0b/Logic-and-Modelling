# Logic and Modelling Cheat Sheet

I'm working on a little pdf with all the rules needed for the 2018 Logic and Modelling course. I'll also be attempting to add explanations of my own, but they may not be perfect. If you want to be added as a collaborator, [send me an email](mailto:github-contact@jacobsburley.com). Or, you can fork this document and submit a pull request with your own changes if you so desire. This document is written in LaTeX, and is automatically compiled and deployed to [releases](https://github.com/jc0b/Logic-and-Modelling/releases) by [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org).

# Known issues
I'm going to try and keep track of the issues that arise with this guide (especially ones that I have with using Travis CI) in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jc0b/Logic-and-Modelling/issues). So, if you want to work on this document as well, keep an eye on the issue tracker for any LaTeX commands that might cause build failures at the moment.
Thanks!

# Acknowledgements
The source for all of the formulas in this document were lifted from the slides for this course provided by JÃ¶rg Endrullis, which can be found on his website [here](http://joerg.endrullis.de/logic-and-modelling/). I have attempted to recreate the rules he defined for his slides, as they were not available in his source.

In turn, any explanations or theory that has been or will be added will be simplified from explanation offered in the book [Logic in Computer Science](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/lics/), written by Professors Mark Ryan and Michael Huth.
